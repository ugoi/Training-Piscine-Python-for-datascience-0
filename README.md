## Chapter I: General Rules
- You have to render your modules from a computer in the cluster using:
  - A virtual machine:
    - Choose the OS for your virtual machine.
    - Your VM must have all the necessary software for your project, fully configured and installed.
  - Or use the computer directly if the required tools are available.
    - Ensure you have enough space on your session to install what's needed for all modules (use the goinfre if your campus has one).
    - All tools must be installed prior to evaluations.
- Functions should not quit unexpectedly (e.g. segmentation fault, bus error). If this occurs, your project is non-functional and will score a 0 during evaluations.
- Creating test programs is recommended. They won't be submitted or graded but will be beneficial for evaluations.
- Submit work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git repository will be graded. If Deepthought grades your work, it follows your peer-evaluations. If an error occurs during Deepthought’s grading, the evaluation halts.
- Python 3.10 is mandatory.
- Any built-in function is allowed unless explicitly prohibited.
- Imports must be explicit (e.g., `import numpy as np`). Using `from pandas import *` is not allowed, resulting in a score of 0 for that exercise.
- No global variables.
- And remember, by Odin, by Thor! Use your brain!
